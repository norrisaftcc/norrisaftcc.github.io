# PokeSense Task Assignments

## Round-Robin Development Approach

Our team will use a round-robin approach to ensure all members gain experience across the full stack while leveraging individual strengths. Each team member will have primary responsibility for specific components but will also contribute to other areas.

## Architecture Overview

PokeSense follows a clear three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│     GUI     │ ↔  │    Logic    │ ↔  │    Data     │
│  (Streamlit)│    │   (Core)    │    │  (Storage)  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
     Brock            Misty             Serena
   (Frontend)      (Business Logic)    (Data Layer)
                                          
                      Ash
                 (Project Lead &
                  Integration)
```

## Cross-Training Schedule

Each week, team members will rotate secondary responsibilities:

| Week | Ash | Misty | Brock | Serena |
|------|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| 1    | Integration | API | UI | Data |
| 2    | Data | Integration | API | UI |
| 3    | UI | Data | Integration | API |
| 4    | API | UI | Data | Integration |

This rotation ensures everyone develops a comprehensive understanding of the entire system while maintaining clear primary responsibilities.

## Development Workflow

1. **Daily Stand-up**: Brief updates on progress and blockers
2. **Weekly Code Review**: Team review of all new components
3. **Bi-weekly Integration Testing**: Verify all components work together
4. **Sprint Demo**: End-of-sprint demonstration of completed features
