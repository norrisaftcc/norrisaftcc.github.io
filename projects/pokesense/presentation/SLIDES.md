## The Problem

Professor Oak's Pokémon Research Lab faces significant challenges:

- Researchers waste hours looking up Pokémon information manually
- Paper-based system is inefficient and prone to loss
- No way to analyze Pokémon data effectively
- Difficult to share knowledge between researchers
- Field research data often gets lost or damaged

> "Our analog record-keeping can't keep pace with discovery."
> — Professor Oak

## Our Solution: PokeSense

A comprehensive Pokémon management system that:

- Provides instant access to the Pokémon database
- Allows researchers to build and annotate collections
- Features intuitive visualization of Pokémon data
- Enables persistent storage and easy retrieval of notes
- Works across all devices in the field

## Architecture

Three-tier design with clean separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│     GUI     │ ↔  │    Logic    │ ↔  │    Data     │
│  (Streamlit)│    │   (Core)    │    │  (Storage)  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘

```

## User Interface

![UI Wireframe](./wireframe_placeholder.png)

*Streamlit-based interface with intuitive design for researchers of all technical levels*

---

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Search** - Find any Pokémon instantly
2. **Collection Management** - Organize research subjects
3. **Detailed Statistics** - Visualize and compare attributes
4. **Research Notes** - Attach custom observations
5. **Type Analysis** - Understand type relationships and coverage

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python-based UI framework)
- **Backend**: Python core modules
- **API**: PokeAPI integration
- **Storage**: JSON file storage (extensible)
- **Deployment**: Local and cloud deployment options

---

## Development Approach

**Round-Robin Development**

| Week | Ash | Misty | Brock | Serena |
|------|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| 1    | Integration | API | UI | Data |
| 2    | Data | Integration | API | UI |
| 3    | UI | Data | Integration | API |
| 4    | API | UI | Data | Integration |

*Team members gain experience across the stack while leveraging individual strengths*

---

## Current Progress

- ✅ Core API integration complete
- ✅ Data models defined and implemented
- ✅ Storage interface working
- ✅ Basic UI wireframes created
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ MVP functionality working

---

## Next Steps

This semester we will:

1. Implement Team Building Module with type analysis
2. Create Evolutionary Chain visualization
3. Develop Field Research Mode for offline use
4. Build Collaborative Collections feature
5. Add Data Export/Import functionality
6. Create Advanced Analytics Dashboard

---

## Live Demo

*Demonstration of PokeSense application highlighting:*

- Searching for Pokémon
- Adding to collection
- Viewing detailed information
- Managing favorites and notes
- Type analysis visualization

---

## Results and Impact

Since implementing PokeSense, Professor Oak's lab has reported:

- 73% reduction in research lookup time
- 100% elimination of lost notes
- 45% increase in collaborative projects
- 92% adoption rate among researchers

---

## Lessons Learned

- Separation of concerns enables collaborative development
- PokeAPI provides rich data but requires caching
- Streamlit offers rapid UI development for data applications
- JSON storage is simple but has scaling limitations
- Round-robin development builds well-rounded developers

## Appendix: API Structure

```python
# Search for Pokémon
results = PokeApiService.search_pokemon("pikachu")

# Get Pokémon details
details = PokeApiService.get_pokemon_details("pikachu")

# Get Pokémon sprite URL
sprite_url = pokemon.sprites.get('front_default')
```
