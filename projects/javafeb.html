    <h1>Building a Number Processor: Part 1</h1>

    <h2>Today's Goal</h2>
    <p>We're going to build a program that takes user input and converts it into a number. This might sound simple, but it teaches us several important programming concepts that we'll use throughout our coding journey.</p>

    <h2>Understanding String Input</h2>
    <p>When someone types something into a JOptionPane dialog, Java sees it as text (a String), even if they type numbers. Think of it like receiving a note - even if someone writes "42" on the paper, it's still just marks on paper until we interpret it as a number.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <p>When a user enters "123" into JOptionPane:</p>
        <pre>String userInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter a number:");</pre>
        <p>userInput contains the characters "1", "2", and "3" - not the actual number 123.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Converting Strings to Numbers</h2>
    <p>Java provides tools to convert text into numbers. The main one we'll use today is Integer.parseInt(). This method tries to convert a String into a whole number.</p>

    <div class="thinking-point">
        <p>Consider what should happen in these cases:</p>
        <pre>
Integer.parseInt("123")   // Seems straightforward...
Integer.parseInt("abc")   // But what about this?
Integer.parseInt("")      // Or this?
Integer.parseInt("3.14")  // Or even this?</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Protecting Our Program with Input Validation</h2>
    <p>Good programs don't crash when users make mistakes. Instead, they provide helpful feedback. Before we even try to convert a String to a number, we should check:</p>
    
    <p>Is there any input at all? If someone just hits "OK" without typing anything, we get an empty String (or possibly null). We should check for this first.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
if (input == null || input.trim().isEmpty()) {
    return "Please enter a number";
}</pre>
        <p>The trim() method removes spaces from the beginning and end of the text. This means "   " (just spaces) counts as empty too!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Handling Conversion Errors</h2>
    <p>When we try to convert a String to a number, things might go wrong. Java uses something called "exceptions" to tell us about these problems. We can catch these exceptions and handle them gracefully:</p>

    <div class="example">
        <pre>
try {
    int number = Integer.parseInt(input);
    // If we get here, the conversion worked!
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    // If we get here, something went wrong
}</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Your Task</h2>
    <p>Complete the process() method in the NumberProcessor class. Your method should:</p>
    <p>1. Check if the input is null or empty</p>
    <p>2. Try to convert the input to an integer</p>
    <p>3. Return appropriate messages for success or failure</p>

    <div class="thinking-point">
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>As you work on this, think about:</p>
        <p>What if we wanted to handle decimal numbers too? What would need to change?</p>
        <p>How could we make our error messages more specific? Should we tell users the difference between "abc" and "3.14" as invalid inputs?</p>
        <p>These questions will lead us into Part 2 of our number processing journey...</p>
