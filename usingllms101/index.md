## Week Two Summary: Exploring Workflows with LLMs and GitHub Pages

This week, we focused on three key workflows that combine the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with various tools for content creation and publication:

1. **LLM to Markdown to HTML/PDF using Dillinger.io**
   - We learned how to generate content using an LLM in Markdown format.
   - We then used Dillinger.io to convert this Markdown into HTML or PDF formats.
   - This workflow demonstrates how to quickly create formatted documents from LLM-generated content.

2. **LLM to Markdown to PowerPoint using Marp with Visual Studio Code**
   - We explored how to use an LLM to create presentation content in Marp-formatted Markdown.
   - We then used the Marp extension in Visual Studio Code to convert this Markdown into a PowerPoint presentation.
   - This workflow showcases how to efficiently create slide decks from LLM output.

3. **Creating a GitHub Pages Website**
   - We learned the process of setting up a GitHub Pages site, including creating a repository and adding content.
   - We then explored how to enhance the site using Markdown and themes.
   - This workflow demonstrates how to quickly publish and customize web content using GitHub's tools.

These workflows highlight the versatility of using LLMs in conjunction with various tools and platforms to streamline content creation, formatting, and publication processes.
