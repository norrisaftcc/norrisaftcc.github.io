# Fayetteville Go!

## Welcome!

<img src="gobook.png" width="560">

Hi! I'm Drew Norris. I'm trying to get a Go club started here in Fayetteville.
You don't need to know how to play -- I'm still learning, as well!

Please sign up at <a href="https://baduk.club/club/fayettevillego">Our Baduk.Club Page</a> -- they're a respected organization, so don't worry.
If you're new, your rank starts at "30 kyu", so you'll want to put that in.

## Purpose
We're looking to get some Go games "going" in Fayetteville! 
Please reach out to Andrew Norris at norrisa@faytechcc.edu if you are interested.
