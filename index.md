# My Projects
Here are a list of projects I'm working on:

- Collaboration tools for 289/Graphic Design (more to come)
- [LinkLoaderVN](https://github.com/norrisaftcc/linkloadervn) - a simple visual novel prototype.
- [CTS 285 Sandbox](https://github.com/norrisaftcc/CTS285_FA22_Sandbox) - sample libraries with examples.

# Useful Links

- [GitHub Pages Quickstart](https://pages.github.com)

# Information for CTI 110
- Remember, you'll want to build on your skills by taking more programming classes! CSC 134, CSC 121, CSC 151 are good next steps.
- Al Sweigart's books are free online and a good place to keep working on Python.
  https://inventwithpython.com/ and I recommend this book specifically: https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/
