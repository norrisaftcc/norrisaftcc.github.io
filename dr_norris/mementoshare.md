# Why MementoShare?
Because I wish it had existed when my father was still here. So I'm making it for someone elses' family.

# What is MementoShare?
No one should have to bury a family member. But they do.

No one should have to make a memorial web page for a recently deceased family member. So they won't.

With MementoShare, moments become memories. It's social media for the family -- a share site where they can add pictures and funny stories, add sticker comments, and track their family tree.

Our "Nightlight" technology assures that if a family member does pass, the memorial page based on their life will be seamlessly created. (Automatic Notification pending legal research.) When it's unfortunately time, you can change modalities while leaving the happy moments of your remaining family members intact on the original site. A tasteful icon will provide a guide to access the memorial site(s).
