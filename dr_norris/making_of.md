# Creating a Memorial with AI Assistance: A Practical Guide
### Created Nov 21, 2024
Creating a memorial page for a loved one is a deeply personal task that can feel overwhelming. While artificial intelligence can't replace the human touch in this process, it can help organize our thoughts and create a structured approach to celebrating a life. 

This guide emerged from a real collaboration between a family member and an AI assistant (operating in concise mode, focusing on clear, direct communication). We (Claude and I) found that by breaking down the process into manageable steps and maintaining a focus on celebration rather than loss, we could create something meaningful while making the process itself less stressful.

## Initial Setup and Approach

You can probably just copy this entire document in as a prompt, or take the parts that are relevant to you. 

Begin by setting clear expectations with your AI assistant. Our key opening instruction was:
"The goal here is to create artifacts celebrating a person's life. Do not use generic condolences; instead, consider asking questions about how to best remember and celebrate their life."

This instruction helps set the right tone and keeps the focus on celebration. You might add specific instructions relevant to your particular LLM to enter concise mode, or just add "Be concise in responses but not necessarily in the created artifacts".

Depending on your LLM, the artifact (typically a web page) will be separate from the main chat, in a download or to the side of the conversation.

## Process Overview

1. **Start with Basic Structure**
   - Begin with essential biographical information
   - Create a clean, professional layout
   - Include dates and key milestones
   - Work iteratively, section by section

2. **Content Development**
   - Start with factual information (timeline, career achievements)
   - Add personal elements gradually
   - Include meaningful quotes
   - Incorporate family history and personal interests

3. **Refinement Process**
   - Make small, focused changes
   - Review one section at a time
   - Keep font and styling consistent
   - Maintain a warm but professional tone

## Key Lessons from Our Process

- **Iterative Development**: We built the page section by section, allowing for careful consideration of each element
- **Clear Instructions**: Specific feedback like "change 'in his final decade' to 'in his retirement years'" helped refine the tone
- **Personal Touches**: Including elements like favorite hobbies (British mysteries) and companions (dog Esther) made the memorial more personal
- **Family Context**: Incorporating family history and genealogy helped create a fuller picture of the person's life
- **Meaningful Quotes**: Using both formal (inauguration) and personal ("How was class today, son?") quotes added depth

## Technical Tips

1. **Document Structure**
   - Use consistent heading hierarchies
   - Maintain clean, readable spacing
   - Include clear sections for different aspects of life
   - Consider mobile responsiveness

2. **Content Organization**
   - Timeline for career achievements
   - Separate sections for personal interests
   - Space for family tributes
   - Memorial contribution information

## Sensitive Aspects to Consider

- Verify dates and facts with family members
- Respect privacy in personal anecdotes
- Balance professional achievements with personal stories
- Consider religious or cultural elements carefully
- Include practical information (memorial contributions) discreetly

## Working with AI Effectively

1. **Clear Instructions**
   - Provide specific guidance about tone
   - Make one change at a time
   - Review and iterate on each section
   - Keep track of elements to verify later

2. **Content Review**
   - Have family members review for accuracy
   - Check dates and titles
   - Verify organizational details
   - Ensure appropriate formatting

## Sample Timeline

1. Basic structure and layout
2. Professional timeline
3. Personal quotes and anecdotes
4. Family history and context
5. Memorial contribution information
6. Final review and refinement

## Publishing the memorial

While the document can be provided to a third party for publication, Github Pages is a free option that is easily approachable. 

## Final Notes

Remember that this is a collaborative process between you, the AI, and family members. Take time to reflect on each addition and modification. The goal is to create a dignified, warm, and accurate memorial that truly celebrates the person's life and legacy.

While AI can help with structure and writing, the personal touches and family memories make the memorial meaningful. Don't hesitate to take breaks during the process and return with fresh perspectives or additional information.

As a real, grieving person who couldn't yet face writing a memorial, having a workflow to guide me was a comfort. I hope that it can provide some comfort to others in the future.
