# KAIDA VOSS

## The Influencer

*“Three million followers watch me work. What they don’t see is more interesting than what they do.”*

-----

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW

**Handle**: KaidaV  
**Clearance**: Freelance contractor (multiple corporate sponsors)  
**Followers**: 3.2M across platforms  
**Primary Sponsor**: Apex Chrome (augmentation tech)  
**Secondary Sponsors**: StreamLine Networks (platform), DataCorp (security consulting)

-----

## THE THREE LAYERS

### What The Audience Sees

KaidaV, tech influencer. Runs data, cracks systems, looks incredible doing it. Every job is content. Every success is a brand moment. The chrome is cutting-edge. The skills are aspirational. The lifestyle is what three million people want.

### What The Corps See

Kaida Voss, security consultant. Penetration testing. Vulnerability assessment. The streaming is marketing—it brings clients. The followers prove her reach. Useful asset with trackable metrics.

### What You Know

You’re actually good at this. The chrome works. The skills are real. But you’ve been performing competence so long that the line between “being good” and “looking good while being good” has dissolved. The sponsors pay well. The followers validate you. The work is real. You’re just not sure which version of yourself is authentic anymore.

## TALENTS (8 Build Points)

### Content Is Currency (4 points)

Your follower count is social capital. Once per session, leverage your platform for automatic success on social engineering or information gathering. “I have 3 million followers” opens doors—sometimes literally.

### Chrome Showcase (2 points)

Your augments are advertisement-grade flagships. When invoking chrome-related aspects, gain +3 instead of +2. Your equipment isn’t just good—it’s showroom-floor perfect.

### Live Backup (2 points)

Everything you see is recorded and backed up to StreamLine servers. Once per session, access perfect recall of any scene you were present for. Review footage frame-by-frame.

**Complication**: StreamLine has the same footage.

-----

## ASPECTS

### High Concept: *Apex-Sponsored Runner With Real Credentials*

You’re on multiple corporate payrolls. Apex sponsors your chrome. StreamLine hosts your content. DataCorp pays for vulnerability assessments. Each thinks they own a piece of you. None realize you’re playing them against each other for access.

**Invoke**: Using corporate sponsorship as cover, leveraging follower count as social proof, when your chrome actually is cutting-edge  
**Compel**: Sponsors demand product placement mid-job, rival corps notice your multiple contracts, follower count makes you recognizable when you need anonymity

### Trouble: *The Performance Is The Person Is The Performance*

You’ve been performing yourself so long you’re not sure where Kaida ends and KaidaV begins. Every job is content. Every interaction is streamable. The chrome that makes you effective also makes you marketable.

**Compel**: Staying in character compromises the mission, choosing between good content and good tactics, being recognized from streams, performing even when cameras are off

### Connection: *Lian Chen, My Producer, Knows Too Much*

Lian edits your streams, manages your sponsors, and sees the uncut footage. They know which jobs you don’t stream. They know the difference between performance and reality. They have leverage. They’re also the only person you trust with that leverage.

**Invoke**: Need footage edited, sponsors managed, someone to cover for you, someone who knows the real you  
**Compel**: Lian’s loyalty tested by better offers, they’re targeted to get to you, they question whether you’re compromising too much

-----

## QUICK REFERENCE

- **Reflexes**: Boosted reactions, combat if necessary
- **Code**: System intrusion, digital security
- **Tech**: Hardware manipulation, your specialty
- **Cool**: Social engineering, maintaining composure, performing confidence

## RELATIONSHIPS

### Lian Chen (Producer/Editor)

Sees uncut footage. Knows which corps you’re working for. Has backend access to neural recorder. Could destroy you with one leak. Hasn’t.

### Apex Chrome Marketing (Primary Sponsor)

Pays for augments. Demands 40% product visibility. Views you as walking advertisement. Will replace you if engagement drops.

### StreamLine Networks (Platform Provider)

Hosts content. Tracks viewers. Owns back catalog. Has access to your neural recorder. “For quality assurance.”

### The Audience (3.2M Followers)

They think they know you. When you go dark, they notice. When you come back different, they’ll know.

-----

## THE CENTRAL QUESTION

*Are you KaidaV performing as Kaida Voss, or Kaida Voss performing as KaidaV?*

When you check follower count between security breaches, is that brand management or genuine insecurity?

When you showcase Apex chrome while cracking corporate encryption, are you fulfilling sponsorship obligations or appreciating good tools?

The chrome is real. The skills are real. The followers are real. The performance is real.

Maybe asking which is authentic is the wrong question.
