# REYES TOVAN

## The Nomad

*“Nobody stops me. Not weather, not corps, not patrol boats. If someone needs to get somewhere, I get them there.”*

-----

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW

**Former Service**: Fujikara-Pacific Maritime Patrol, 8 years  
**Current Status**: Independent captain, wanted for desertion and vessel theft  
**Primary Vessel**: *Mirasol* (pelagic surface transport)  
**Secondary Vessel**: *(Player’s Choice - see options below)*  
**Specialty**: Routes nobody else knows, passengers nobody else will take

-----

## THE THREE LAYERS

### What Authorities See

Reyes Tovan, deserter. Stole Fujikara-Pacific patrol vessel FP-2847 (renamed *Mirasol*). Active warrant. Bounty increases with each smuggling charge. Former specialist in deep-water navigation and storm prediction. Dangerous because he knows patrol patterns from the inside.

### What The Street Sees

Captain Tovan. Reliable. Expensive but worth it. Takes refugees when other smugglers won’t. Never abandons passengers. The Mirasol runs routes through toxic storms that would kill anyone else. Ex-military means he’s competent. The fact he deserted means he has principles. Or at least broke his old ones.

### What You Know

You flew where they ordered you for eight years. Good soldier. Better pilot. Then they ordered you to transport Golgotha miners to “processing centers”—corporate prison for trying to unionize. You flew them to the nearest independent station instead. Stole the patrol boat. Disappeared into the storm belts. Now you run refugees when you can, cargo when you must. The Mirasol is falling apart. The bounty makes every port dangerous. But every family you get off Golgotha makes it worth it.

## YOUR VESSELS

### Primary: The Mirasol (Pelagic Surface Transport)

**Stolen Fujikara-Pacific patrol boat, extensively modified**

**Systems Stress**: ▢▢▢▢▢▢  
**Capabilities**:

- Toxic atmosphere rated (Golgotha-safe)
- Storm-capable (can navigate radiation belts and dust storms)
- Fast for its class (military engines, poorly maintained)
- Armed (light defensive weapons, mostly for deterrence)
- Cramped (can carry 8 passengers uncomfortably)

**Signature Feature**: Knows every storm pattern between Golgotha and Sidereal. Can run routes through weather that would kill commercial vessels.

**The Problem**: Falling apart. Maintenance costs more than you make. Every job risks catastrophic failure. But it’s home.

**Recognition Risk**: Fujikara-Pacific has hull signature on file. Running quiet means disabling transponder, which is itself illegal.

-----

### Secondary Vessel (Choose One)

#### Option A: The *Whisper* (Orbital Shuttle)

**Light passenger shuttle, bought with smuggling profits**

**Systems Stress**: ▢▢▢▢  
**Capabilities**:

- Orbital-to-surface rated
- Stealth coating (commercial-grade, not military)
- Comfortable (can carry 4 passengers in actual comfort)
- Fast atmospheric flight
- No weapons

**Why You Have It**: The Mirasol can’t reach Sidereal Station. You needed orbital capability for the full route. Whisper is legal, registered, clean. Your “legitimate” business.

**The Trade-Off**: Whisper pays bills. Mirasol saves lives. You keep them separate.

-----

#### Option B: The *Undertow* (Submarine Transport)

**Surplus deep-water transport, military origins unclear**

**Systems Stress**: ▢▢▢▢▢  
**Capabilities**:

- Deep water rated (can run Golgotha’s sunken sectors)
- Silent running (designed for stealth)
- Can carry cargo or 6 passengers
- Slow but undetectable
- Torpedo capability (two tubes, rarely used)

**Why You Have It**: Some refugees can’t take surface routes. Some cargo needs to arrive unseen. Undertow runs where patrol boats can’t follow.

**The Trade-Off**: Operating costs are brutal. Sonar signature is cleaner than transponder, but not invisible.

-----

#### Option C: The *Horizon* (Racing Yacht)

**Fast luxury vessel, won in a card game (probably rigged)**

**Systems Stress**: ▢▢▢▢  
**Capabilities**:

- Fastest thing on the water (stripped down, overpowered)
- Luxurious (attracts no suspicion in corporate ports)
- Experimental stabilizers (handles like a dream)
- Minimal cargo space
- No weapons, not rated for toxic atmosphere

**Why You Have It**: Sometimes you need to move fast and look legitimate. Horizon docks at Sidereal ports where Mirasol would trigger alarms. Also, it’s the first nice thing you’ve owned since desertion.

**The Trade-Off**: Maintaining racing yacht while living like refugee smuggler creates cognitive dissonance. Also, you’re pretty sure the previous owner wants it back.

-----

#### Option D: Custom Vessel

**Work with GM to design your second boat**

- Define capabilities and trade-offs
- Set Systems stress track (4-6 boxes)
- Establish why you have it and what it costs to maintain
- Create one signature feature and one problem

-----

## TALENTS (8 Build Points)

### Know the Routes (4 points)

Once per session, declare you know a route that gets the crew where they need to go. It might be dangerous, slow, or expensive, but it exists and you know it. No roll required. GM tells you the cost or risk.

### Combat Pilot (2 points)

+2 to Reflexes when piloting in combat or evasion situations. You’ve been shot at before. You know how to not get hit.

### Emergency Repairs (2 points)

+2 to Tech for field repairs on your vessels. Repairs made this way hold until the job is done, then need proper fixing. You can keep a dying boat flying on prayers and wire.

-----

## ASPECTS

### High Concept: *Ex-Fujikara Patrol Captain Who Stole His Boat*

You know maritime patrol patterns, military protocols, and storm routes from years of service. You also know exactly how they hunt deserters. The boat you stole was your patrol vessel. They want it back. They want you in prison. Neither is negotiable.

**Invoke**: Knowledge of patrol patterns, military training, navigation expertise, when your military background helps  
**Compel**: Recognized by former colleagues, patrol boats spot the Mirasol, military protocols surface under stress, bounty increases

### Trouble: *Can’t Say No to People Desperate Enough to Ask*

You take passengers you shouldn’t. Refugees who can’t pay full rate. People running from the same corps you’re hiding from. Every job that matters increases the heat. But you couldn’t live with yourself if you left them behind.

**Compel**: Taking passengers who can’t pay, risking everything for strangers, letting someone aboard who endangers the crew, reputation attracts the desperate

### Connection: *The Mirasol Is the Only Home I’ve Ever Had*

The boat is falling apart. Maintenance costs more than you earn. Parts are scarce. Every job risks catastrophic failure. But it’s yours. You stole it to save lives. It’s kept you free for three years. You’ll die before you abandon it.

**Invoke**: Pushing the boat beyond safe limits, knowing exactly how it handles, bond with your vessel  
**Compel**: Choosing to repair the boat over personal needs, can’t abandon it even tactically, emotional attachment clouds judgment

-----

## STARTING GEAR

### Navigation Equipment

- Military-grade charts (storm routes, patrol patterns, hidden harbors)
- Weather prediction software (military surplus, technically illegal)
- Current sensors and depth sounders
- Backup navigation computer (the main one is dying)

### Safety Equipment

- Environmental suits for passengers (8 sets, various states of repair)
- Respirators (Golgotha-rated, mandatory)
- Emergency supplies (oxygen, rations, medical kit)
- Life raft (inflatable, never tested)

### Personal Kit

- Sidearm (military issue, serial numbers filed off)
- Tool kit (comprehensive, well-used)
- Stimulant doses (4 remaining, hard to replace)
- Encrypted comm (for passenger coordination)

### Maintenance Budget

- 1,500 credits (most earmarked for Mirasol repairs)
- Parts stockpile (scavenged, questionable quality)
- Favor owed by dock master at The Raft (worth about 2,000 credits in repairs)

-----

## FATE POINTS

**Starting**: 3 per session

**Spend to**:

- Invoke aspects
- Push your boats past safe limits
- Emergency stimulant activation
- Refuse being taken out

**Gain when**:

- Can’t say no to refugees
- Former colleagues recognize you
- The Mirasol breaks down at worst time
- Military protocols betray you

-----

## ROLEPLAYING REYES

### Voice & Mannerisms

- Quiet and direct. No wasted words.
- Military posture when stressed (you catch yourself standing at attention)
- Check weather patterns obsessively
- Refer to boats as “she,” never “it”
- Touch controls gently—you know exactly how close to failure everything is

### Speech Patterns

- “Nobody stops me.”
- “The route exists. Question is whether you’re willing to pay the cost.”
- “I’ve run worse storms than this.”
- “They’re desperate. We’re taking them.”
- Slip into military jargon under pressure (“Copy,” “Affirmative,” “Go for Tovan”)

### Complications You Bring

- Active desertion warrant with increasing bounty
- Fujikara-Pacific patrol boats recognize the Mirasol
- Taking passengers who can’t pay means constant financial pressure
- Maintenance costs exceed income
- Former colleagues in every port might recognize you
- The boats are always one breakdown from catastrophic failure

### What You Want

- Keep flying. Stay free.
- Get enough ahead to properly repair the Mirasol
- Reduce the bounty somehow (or get far enough away it doesn’t matter)
- Save enough lives to balance the ones you couldn’t save
- Prove desertion was right call

### What You Fear

- The boats failing with passengers aboard
- Being captured and returned to Fujikara-Pacific
- Having to choose between saving passengers and saving yourself
- That you’re just running and calling it freedom
- That eventually the math catches up—you can’t save everyone

-----

## RELATIONSHIPS

### Fujikara-Pacific Maritime Command

You were Specialist Tovan, patrol boat FP-2847, eight years service, exemplary record. Then you stole the boat and disappeared. They’re not sentimental about desertion. The bounty increases with each smuggling charge.

### The Raft (Independent Station)

Dock Master Kova gives you berth when you need it. Doesn’t ask questions. You’ve paid in repairs, intelligence, and keeping refugees moving. The Raft doesn’t care about corporate warrants. But they care about credits.

### Refugees You’ve Transported

Forty-seven people owe their freedom to you. Some paid full fare. Most didn’t. They know your name. Some would hide you. Some would sell you. Most don’t have the resources to do either.

### Corporate Sponsors (Rejected)

Apex Chrome offered to sponsor the Mirasol—free upgrades, maintenance coverage, featured in some influencer’s streams. You said no immediately. Freedom doesn’t come with corporate logos. They didn’t understand. They still don’t.

-----

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Best At**: Piloting (anything that flies/floats), navigation through hazards, keeping dying machinery functional, endurance, staying calm under pressure

**Weak At**: Social situations (military directness doesn’t translate), hacking (you fly boats, not networks), saying no to refugees, financial planning, trusting corporations

**When You Roll**:

- **Body**: Endurance, manual labor, surviving harsh environments
- **Reflexes**: Piloting, evasion, navigation, combat when necessary
- **Code**: You don’t (hire a hacker)
- **Tech**: Repairs, jury-rigging, keeping boats functional
- **Cool**: Resisting authority, staying calm in storms, intimidation through competence

-----

## YOUR PLAYBOOK MOVE: NOBODY STOPS ME

Once per session, when authority tries to stop you—checkpoint, blockade, customs, patrol boat—you can declare: **“Nobody stops me.”**

You’re getting through. Roll Reflexes:

- **Success**: Clean passage. They can’t pursue or don’t know which route you took.
- **Failure**: You’re through, but they know who you are, your boat takes damage, or you had to leave something/someone behind.

This works once because they underestimate you, don’t expect your route, or can’t follow where you go. After that, they know you’re serious.

Your boat might suffer, but you get where you’re going.

-----

## ADVANCEMENT

After major story milestones, choose one:

- Increase stat (+1, max +3)
- Gain new talent
- Upgrade boat (increase stress boxes or add capability)
- Buy off Severe consequence
- Reduce bounty (requires narrative justification)
- Acquire better equipment
- Establish new safe harbor

-----

**Nerves**: *Shaken by Near-Miss*, *Guilty About Passenger Left Behind*  
**Systems**: *Chrome Lagging*, *Interface Feedback*

**Boat (Mild)**: *Engine Running Hot*, *Hull Micro-fractures*, *Sensor Drift*

### Moderate (4 stress)

-----

## MILITARY BACKGROUND: PROTOCOLS & KNOWLEDGE

### You Know

- Fujikara-Pacific patrol patterns (which routes they cover, when shifts change)
- Naval command structure and communication protocols
- Storm navigation techniques (military-grade training)
- Combat evasion procedures
- What triggers pursuit and what they’ll ignore

### They Know

- Your piloting signature (the way you handle boats is distinctive)
- Your service record (which means your capabilities)
- That you won’t abandon passengers (predictable behavior)
- Which harbors you’ve used (pattern recognition)

### The Tension

Every time you use military knowledge, you risk triggering military responses. The protocols that keep you alive also mark you as former service. Every evasion technique you use confirms their suspicion that you’re Tovan.

-----

## VEHICLE MAINTENANCE

**Monthly Costs (Minimum)**:

- Mirasol: 1,200 credits (critical systems only)
- Second boat: 600-1,000 credits depending on type
- Both boats need repairs: 1,800-2,200 credits/month
- Your average job pays: 2,500 credits
- Refugees pay: Whatever they have (usually not enough)

**The Math**: You’re always behind. Every job that matters loses money. Every month you choose between proper repairs and keeping passengers safe. The boats are deteriorating faster than you can fix them.

**The Choice**: Stop taking refugees and save enough for real repairs. Or keep running passengers and watch the boats slowly die.

You keep taking passengers.

-----

## THE CENTRAL QUESTION

*What does freedom cost when you measure it in other people’s lives?*

You deserted to save forty-seven people. The boats are dying. The bounty is growing. Every passenger you take increases the risk to everyone aboard.

At what point does saving one more person become sacrificing everyone?

You don’t have an answer. You just keep flying.
