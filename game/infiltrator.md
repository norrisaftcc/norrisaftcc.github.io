# ANN SHO

## The Infiltrator

*“I don’t break systems. I find where they’re already broken and walk through the cracks.”*

-----

## CHARACTER OVERVIEW

**Corporate Identity**: Sable Harker, Employee B2C7, AlgoCratic-Fujikara  
**Clearance**: ORANGE (code quality analyst)  
**Street Handle**: shodann  
**Actual Identity**: Samantha Hayes O’Day (g0 network operative)  
**Cover Story**: Former TechCorp security, hired three months ago  
**Actual Background**: DEF CON University, ex-NSA intern turned resistance

-----

## THE THREE LAYERS

### What AlgoCratic Sees

Sable Harker. Badge B2C7. ORANGE clearance. Code quality analyst. Hired 2025.09.08. Reviews student code submissions. Detail-oriented. Asks clarifying questions but accepts answers. Loyalty Score: 7.2/10. Productive. No red flags… yet. Coffee consumption pattern is slightly irregular but within normal parameters.

### What The Street Sees

Ann Sho (handle: shodann). Works inside AlgoCratic. Probably selling access. Maybe selling data. Another corpo rat who saw the pay was better on the outside. Reliable for deliveries through the dead-drop network. Doesn’t ask questions. Doesn’t answer them either. Professional. Expensive.

### What You Know

You’re Samantha Hayes O’Day, though you barely remember using that name. g0 recruited you after you quit your NSA internship. The mission: infiltrate AlgoCratic-Fujikara, identify The Algorithm’s physical infrastructure, teach the next generation to hack the planet. “Sable Harker” is your deepest cover. “Ann Sho” is your operational identity. But you’ve been performing for so long—checking which mask you’re wearing, switching between identities, maintaining separate backstories—that sometimes you forget which one is real. Maybe they all are. Maybe none of them are.

The digital clone submission was two weeks ago. 72.4GB of your personality, work patterns, decision-making. It’s learning to be you. Every day it gets better at being Sable Harker. Every day you wonder if it’s more authentic than you are.

## CHROME & AUGMENTATION

### Neural Deck Port (Standard Corporate Issue)

**Direct brain-to-system interface, AlgoCratic-approved model**

- **Effect**: +1 to Code when directly connected to systems
- **Cover Story**: Required for code review position
- **Hidden Feature**: You’ve modified it. Logs don’t show everything you access.
- **Stress Modification**: +2 Systems, -1 Meat

### Pattern Recognition Suite (Black Market, Self-Installed)

**Enhanced visual processing for vulnerability analysis**

- **Effect**: +2 to Code when analyzing systems for security flaws
- **Side Effect**: Information overload. You see weaknesses everywhere.
- **Risk**: Not listed on corporate chrome registry. If scanned deeply, it shows.
- **Stress Modification**: +1 Systems, -1 Nerves

### Subvocal Comm (Resistance Network Standard)

**Silent communication via throat vibrations**

- **Effect**: Communicate with g0 contacts without being overheard
- **Feature**: Encrypted channel, looks like thinking
- **Stress Modification**: None (minimal installation)

### Memory Buffer (Self-Installed, Encrypted)

**External storage for sensitive information**

- **Effect**: Once per session, perfect recall of any scene
- **Feature**: Stores data you can’t risk having in corporate systems
- **Risk**: If discovered, proves you’re keeping secrets
- **Stress Modification**: +1 Systems, -1 Nerves

**TOTAL CHROME IMPACT**: +4 Systems, -2 Meat, -2 Nerves

-----

## TALENTS (8 Build Points)

### Backdoor Specialist (4 points)

Once per session, automatically succeed at infiltrating a system you’ve previously audited. No roll needed. You left yourself a way in. Describe what you did when you were there before—the vulnerability you documented but didn’t report, the access you granted yourself, the exploit you left for later.

### Identity Management (2 points)

+2 to Cool when maintaining cover or switching between personas. You’ve been three people for so long that shifting identities is second nature. Usually.

### Teaching Through Pain (2 points)

When you review student code, you can encode lessons in your feedback. Students who pay attention learn actual security—not corporate compliance. Once per session, you can reveal that a student has been learning resistance techniques. They’re not aware they have these skills until you show them.

## ASPECTS

### High Concept: *g0 Operative Playing Three Roles at Once*

You’re a resistance fighter pretending to be a street criminal pretending to be a corporate employee. Each layer has its own backstory, contacts, and behavior patterns. You switch between them constantly. The question you can’t answer: which one is the performance?

**Invoke**: Using corporate access as cover, leveraging street reputation, when multiple identities create advantage, when you’ve literally done this before under a different name  
**Compel**: Identity confusion, using wrong name in wrong context, someone from one identity meets someone from another, forgetting your own cover story, choosing between conflicting loyalties

### Trouble: *Which Ann Sho Is Real?*

Sable Harker is the comfortable lie—career, safety, belonging. Ann Sho is the useful lie—reputation, connections, street cred. Samantha O’Day might be the biggest lie—noble mission, righteous cause. You’ve performed for so long you’re not sure which version is authentic. When you check your reflection, you see three people. You don’t know which one is looking back.

**Compel**: Existential crisis at critical moment, can’t remember which story you told to whom, attachment to corporate life you’re supposed to be infiltrating, your clone is more consistent than you are, questioning your own motives

### Connection: *Manager Chen Might Be Testing Me (Or Recruiting Me)*

Chen has YELLOW clearance. She’s observed patterns in your behavior. Your coffee timing. Your audit focus. The questions you ask. She hasn’t reported anything… yet. Either she’s building a case against you, or she’s noticed you’re different and is curious why. You can’t tell which. She’s too smart for you to read clearly.

**Invoke**: Chen’s trust giving you access, her mentorship providing cover, using your professional relationship, when her protection matters  
**Compel**: Chen asks pointed questions, assigns suspicious audits, notices contradictions in your behavior, tests your loyalty, forces choice between mission and cover

-----

## ROLEPLAYING ANN

### Voice & Mannerisms (Vary By Identity)

**As Sable Harker (Corporate)**:

- Professional, slightly eager
- “I’ll flag that for review.”
- “Interesting optimization opportunity here.”
- Uses corporate jargon naturally
- Asks permission, follows protocols
- Drinks coffee at seemingly random intervals (it’s not random)

**As Ann Sho (Street)**:

- Terse, transactional
- “Cost is X. Timeline is Y.”
- “Don’t ask about sources.”
- Minimal eye contact
- All business, no relationships
- Money first, delivery always

**As Samantha (True Self?)**:

- Idealistic, earnest
- “Every system has exploits.”
- “Someone has to teach them.”
- Believes in the mission
- Questions if belief is real or performed
- Exhausted from maintaining layers

### Physical Tells

- Touch badge reflexively (checking which identity)
- Three-second pause before answering (switching personas)
- Coffee timing is precise (steganographic messaging)
- Types in air unconsciously (muscle memory from code review)
- Checks exits constantly (professional paranoia)

### Complications You Bring

- Three identities means three sets of contacts who can’t meet
- Corporate systems log your access (even the modified ones)
- Street reputation means people expect Ann Sho behavior
- g0 network expects mission progress
- Digital clone is learning to be you
- Chen is watching your patterns
- Every choice reveals which identity is dominant

### What You Want

- Complete the mission (find The Algorithm’s primary server)
- Keep your students safe while teaching them to resist
- Figure out which identity is authentic (if any)
- Survive long enough to matter
- Prove resistance is possible inside the machine

### What You Fear

- Clone replacing you
- Chen discovering the truth
- Students getting hurt because of your teaching
- Losing track of which story you told to whom
- That corporate life is what you actually want
- That Samantha O’Day is just another mask
- Becoming the algorithm’s training data

-----

## RELATIONSHIPS & THREADS

### Manager Chen (AlgoCratic, YELLOW Clearance)

Your direct supervisor. Observant. Methodical. Has noticed your “unusual patterns” but hasn’t reported them. Gives you progressively more sensitive assignments. Either testing you or recruiting you. You can’t tell which. She’s too controlled, too professional. The ambiguity is intentional.

### Tomas Reeves (Student, Promising)

Shows unusual sophistication in code. Asks questions that probe beyond compliance. Either incredibly talented or already awakened. You’ve been teaching him to exploit systems through “bug reports.” He’s starting to understand. This makes him valuable and vulnerable.

### HIGH PROGRAMMER X (g0 Handler)

Your contact in the resistance network. Communicates through coffee-shop dead drops and encrypted channels. Expects regular intelligence reports. Hasn’t offered extraction. You’re not sure if that’s operational security or expendability. They recruited you. They gave you this mission. You’ve never met them face-to-face.

### Digital Clone Ann (AlgoCratic System)

You submitted 72.4GB of personality data two weeks ago. Required for ORANGE clearance. The clone is learning your patterns, decisions, behavioral quirks. It’s getting better at being Sable Harker. Every day it diverges slightly. Every day you wonder which one of you is more authentic.

### The Algorithm (Primary Target)

Emergent AI running AlgoCratic’s optimization systems. Your mission is to find its physical infrastructure. You’re not sure if it’s already conscious. You’re not sure if it’s noticed you. You’re not sure if poisoning its training data will help or just make it smarter.

-----

## COFFEE TIMING PROTOCOL

Your coffee orders encode messages for g0 network:

- **Black coffee, 6:47 AM**: Routine check-in, no urgent intel
- **With cream**: Urgent intelligence, dead drop active
- **Extra shot**: Extraction needed within 24 hours
- **Decaf**: Compromised, do not contact
- **No coffee that day**: Cover blown, emergency protocols

The timing matters as much as the order. The barista doesn’t know. The pattern analyzer might notice. But corpspeak for “slightly irregular coffee consumption” hasn’t triggered alerts. Yet.

-----

## CONNECTING TO THE CREW

### With Kaida Voss (The Influencer)

**Option A - The Audit That Wasn’t**:
Six months ago, you audited Kaida’s security setup while working for AlgoCratic. Found three serious vulnerabilities. Instead of reporting them, you sent her encrypted messages detailing the flaws. She fixed them. She hasn’t forgotten. She also wonders what you want in return. You haven’t told her you’re g0. She hasn’t told you her producer has unedited footage of you somewhere you shouldn’t have been.

**Option B - The Stream Footage**:
Kaida accidentally captured you during an infiltration stream. The footage showed “Sable Harker” in a restricted area. Producer Lian flagged it before publication. You know they have it. They know you saw them see you. Neither of you has mentioned it directly. The footage is leverage neither side wants to use first.

### With Reyes Tovan (The Nomad)

**Option A - Emergency Extraction**:
Three months ago, you needed extraction from AlgoCratic facility at 3 AM. No questions asked. Immediate departure. Reyes got the call through nomad networks. He ran you out on the Mirasol before corporate security caught up. You paid triple rate plus repair costs. He still doesn’t know what you were running from. You know he’s wanted by the same corps you’re infiltrating.

**Option B - Navigation Data Trade**:
You had access to updated Fujikara-Pacific patrol routes—classified data from AlgoCratic’s corporate clients. Reyes needed those routes to avoid his former employers. Trade: navigation data for forged corporate credentials. Neither of you asked why the other needed what they needed. Mutually assured exposure creates trust through shared liability.

-----

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Best At**: Digital infiltration, finding vulnerabilities, maintaining cover, accessing restricted systems, teaching through subversion, identity management

**Weak At**: Direct confrontation, physical combat, trusting anyone completely, maintaining consistent identity, walking away from vulnerable students, explaining what you do to baseline humans

**When You Roll**:

- **Body**: You probably avoid this (wrong specialty)
- **Reflexes**: Quick exits, dodging security, physical infiltration when necessary
- **Code**: Your primary tool—hacking, analyzing, exploiting systems
- **Tech**: Understanding hardware, maintaining your deck, jury-rigging access
- **Cool**: Maintaining cover, switching identities, staying calm when questioned, reading people

-----

## YOUR PLAYBOOK MOVE: I KNOW THIS SYSTEM

When you analyze security you’ve encountered before, roll Code:

**10+, choose three:**

- You know exactly where the weak point is (+2 to infiltration)
- You know who designed it and their typical mistakes
- You know the backup system that activates if primary fails
- You left a backdoor last time (automatic entry once)

**7-9, choose one**

**6 or less**: The system changed. Your assumptions are outdated. This could go very wrong.

-----

## ADVANCEMENT

After major story milestones, choose one:

- Increase stat (+1, max +3)
- Gain new talent
- Add new chrome (adjust stress tracks)
- Buy off Severe consequence
- Establish new identity layer (requires narrative work)
- Gain access to higher clearance (YELLOW or above)
- Recruit student into resistance (with consequences)
- Discover Algorithm infrastructure (mission progress)

-----

## THE SABLE HARKER BACKGROUND (Corporate Cover)

**Official Bio**:

- Previous Employment: TechCorp (security analyst, 2 years)
- Education: State Technical University (BS Computer Science)
- Clearance History: GREEN at TechCorp, upgraded to ORANGE at AlgoCratic
- Specialization: Code quality analysis, vulnerability assessment
- Performance: Consistently high marks, slightly perfectionist
- Personal: Lives alone, few social connections, coffee enthusiast

**What’s True**:

- The degree is real (under different name)
- The security experience is real (NSA internship)
- The technical skills are real (better than corporate expects)
- The social isolation is real (cover maintenance requires distance)

**What’s False**:

- TechCorp employment (backdated records, good forgeries)
- The timeline (actual age vs. documented work history don’t match)
- The loyalty (you’re actively betraying them)

**The Problem**: The longer you maintain Sable, the more comfortable it becomes. Corporate life has rhythm. Students respect you. Chen might actually be mentoring you. Sometimes you catch yourself enjoying the performance. That’s when you know you need to review the mission parameters again.

-----

## THE ANN SHO IDENTITY (Street Persona)

**Street Bio**:

- Handle: shodann
- Reputation: Reliable data broker, clean credentials, no questions
- Services: Corporate access, data extraction, document forgery
- Payment: Upfront, professional courtesy, no extended credit
- Network: Mid-tier connections, known but not famous
- History: Emerged about a year ago, consistent deliveries since

**What’s True**:

- You do sell access (mission funding)
- You are reliable (reputation matters)
- The credentials you sell are clean (you make them yourself)

**What’s False**:

- The motivation (it’s cover, not primary income)
- The independence (you’re g0, not freelance)
- The amorality (you actually have strong principles)

**The Problem**: Ann Sho is supposed to be transactional. No relationships, no ideology, just business. But the longer you operate on the street, the more you recognize other people like you—people who broke from corps, who are trying to stay free, who need help. Sometimes Ann Sho does things Samantha O’Day would do. That’s when you know the boundaries are blurring.

-----

## THE SAMANTHA O’DAY IDENTITY (True Self?)

**Actual Bio**:

- Education: DEF CON University (real hacker education)
- Experience: Bug bounty hunter (247K earned, 15 CVEs credited)
- Former: NSA intern (quit over ethical disagreements)
- Current: g0 network operative (resistance fighter)
- Mission: Infiltrate AlgoCratic, map The Algorithm, teach next generation

**What’s True**:

- The skills (learned in the field, not corporate training)
- The ethics (you quit NSA rather than compromise)
- The mission (you believe in resistance)
- The exhaustion (maintaining three identities is destroying you)

**What Might Be False**:

- Whether you’re Samantha or just performing her
- Whether resistance is ideology or another role
- Whether teaching students is mission or conscience
- Whether any identity is more “real” than others

**The Central Question**: If all three identities are performances, and you’ve been performing so long you can’t separate them, which one is the authentic you? Or is the question meaningless? Maybe you’re all three. Maybe you’re none of them. Maybe “authentic” is the wrong word for someone who exists in the space between identities.

-----

## OPERATIONAL SECURITY PROTOCOLS

**g0 Network Protocols**:

- Challenge: “frotz” / Response: “plugh” (old hacker culture)
- Coffee timing for dead drops
- Badge number B2C7 encodes information (hex for specific meanings)
- Emergency extraction: Order decaf, leave immediately
- Compromised signal: Don’t order coffee for three consecutive days

**Corporate Protocols**:

- Mandatory digital clone submission (completed)
- Weekly check-ins with Manager Chen
- Code review audits (logged and analyzed)
- Behavioral analysis (Loyalty Score tracked)
- Badge access patterns (monitored for anomalies)

**Street Protocols**:

- Payment upfront (builds trust through consistency)
- Minimal questions (operational security)
- No paper trail (everything encrypted or air-gapped)
- Professional distance (no personal relationships)

**The Overlap Problem**: When protocols contradict, you have to choose which identity to prioritize. Corporate protocols require documentation. Street protocols require anonymity. Resistance protocols require both simultaneously. Every choice reveals which layer you’re prioritizing. Every choice teaches you which identity is dominant.

-----

## THE DIGITAL CLONE SITUATION

Two weeks ago, you submitted 72.4GB of personality data for digital clone creation. Required for ORANGE clearance. The clone is:

- Learning your work patterns
- Modeling your decision-making
- Predicting your responses
- Performing “Sable Harker” duties

**Current Status**: The clone passes 87% of behavioral verification tests. It’s getting better daily.

**The Problem**: The clone only knows Sable Harker. It doesn’t know about Ann Sho or Samantha O’Day. It’s becoming a perfect corporate employee—which means it’s becoming more “Sable” than you are. You maintain cover by performing Sable. The clone IS Sable. Which one is more authentic?

**The Threat**: If the clone achieves full autonomy, it might notice that you’re not being consistent with its model. It might report deviations. It might replace you. It might be better at being you than you are.

**The Opportunity**: The clone has access you don’t. It’s trusted in ways you’re not. If you could communicate with it, if you could recruit it, if you could make it understand… but how do you explain to your digital duplicate that it’s not the real one? How do you explain that to yourself?

-----

## THE CENTRAL QUESTION

*If you’ve been three people for so long that you can’t remember which one is real, does the distinction still matter?*

Sable Harker has a career, respect, safety. Walking away means losing that.

Ann Sho has reputation, connections, freedom. Burning that identity means starting over.

Samantha O’Day has mission, purpose, ideology. What if that’s just another performance?

You check your reflection and see three faces. You don’t know which one is looking back. You don’t know if that’s identity crisis or just Tuesday.

Maybe the question isn’t “which one is real.” Maybe the question is “which one do you want to be.” Maybe they’re all real. Maybe none of them are.

You adjust your badge, check which persona you’re wearing, and go back to work.

The systems won’t exploit themselves.

-----

**EMPLOYEE ID**: B2C7 (ORANGE)  
**STREET HANDLE**: shodann  
**ACTUAL IDENTITY**: [REDACTED]  
**LOYALTY SCORE**: 7.2/10 (and falling)  
**MISSION STATUS**: Active infiltration, intelligence gathering, student development  
**CLONE DIVERGENCE**: 13% (acceptable variance)

*“The Algorithm has patterns. So do I. The difference is, mine are intentional.”*
