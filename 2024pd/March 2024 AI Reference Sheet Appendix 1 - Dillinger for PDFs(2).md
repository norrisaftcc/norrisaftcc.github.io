Your best bet is to try a few of these tools and see what you think. They are listed in no particular order. 
## ChatGPT
- **URL:** [https://openai.com/gpt](https://openai.com/gpt)
- **Description:** ChatGPT is the McDonalds of AI -- bland and ubiquitous. I am moving towards Pi/Claude/Copilot for daily tasks. 
- **Pricing/Signup:** Free account, pay per month, or pay per credit used (this last option involves using the platform interface)

## Pi
- **URL:** [https://pi.ai](https://pi.ai)
- **Description:** Pi is one of the easiest to access for general "chat", as it has easily selectable topics that generate a prompt for you, and you can start using it without signing up. The mobile app is easy to voice chat with.
- **Pricing/Signup:** Pi is free or subscription

## Claude
- **URL:** [https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
- **Description:** Claude 3 is new, and worth exploring. It's extremely powerful. It's an easy choice for "summarize this PDF" type of tasks as the file upload is simple.
- **Pricing/Signup:** Claude offers a tiered pricing structure, with a basic free plan.

## Poe
- **URL:** [https://poe.com](https://poe.com)
- **Description:** Poe allows you to use models from OpenAI, Claude, and many others, all in the same interface. This is probably the best way to compare models directly.
- **Pricing/Signup:** Free use with account, subscription

## Microsoft Copilot
- **URL:** [https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
- **Description:** Microsoft Copilot is now the branding for BingGPT. General chat AI interface with websearching enabled by default.
- **Pricing/Signup:** Works with your AD Microsoft account. 


## Dillinger
See *Appendix 1 - Dillinger for PDFs* for full details.
- **URL:** [https://dillinger.io/](https://dillinger.io/)
The benefit here is that any LLM can easily generate Markdown, which Dillinger can render as a HTML or PDF file.
(I haven't tested it yet, but I believe you can use Dillinger to convert HTML from Blackboard into Markdown as well)
