        <div class="section-header">[1.0] INTRO - WHY THIS GUIDE EXISTS</div>

        <p>Greetings, Past Me! It's Future You writing from Week 8, where I just aced my final portfolio presentation and landed an internship because my GitHub looks INSANE.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">**THE BRUTAL TRUTH:**</span> This course isn't really about AI. It's about turning you into someone who can work like a professional developer while using AI as your superpower. By Week 8, you'll have skills that make computer science majors jealous.</p>

        <p><span class="tip">**THE GOOD NEWS:**</span> If you follow this guide, you'll avoid the noob traps that wasted my time and stress. The course is actually designed to make you successful if you just... follow the process.</p>

        <p><span class="tip">**THE WEIRD NEWS:**</span> Your biggest ally isn't the instructor. It's Kevin from IT (aka GitHub Copilot). Seriously. You'll understand later.</p>

        <p><span class="spoiler">**SPOILER ALERT:**</span> The "assistants" you build in Week 1-2 will evolve into something that actually changes how you work and study. No cap.</p>

        <div class="section-header">[2.0] CHARACTER CREATION (Week 1 Setup)</div>

        <div class="subsection">### [2.1] CHOOSING YOUR CLASS</div>
        <p>You don't know this yet, but you're about to pick one of two character classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PROMPT MASTER</strong> [Wizard Class]: Masters AI through perfect communication</li>
            <li><strong>CODE BUILDER</strong> [Engineer Class]: Creates AI tools others can use</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="tip">**PRO TIP:**</span> Don't stress about this choice. You'll know which one you are after building your first assistants. Trust the process.</p>

        <div class="subsection">### [2.2] ESSENTIAL STARTING GEAR</div>
        <div class="code-block">
REQUIRED ACCOUNTS:
□ GitHub account (your new permanent address on the internet)
□ Google account for Gemini Flash (your main weapon)  
□ Class organization invite (your guild membership)

OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED:
□ Slack/Discord for unofficial help
□ Note-taking app that isn't your assistants (ironic, I know)
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">### [2.3] THE MINDSET RESPEC</div>
        <p><span class="warning">**MOST IMPORTANT:**</span> Stop thinking "I need to learn AI." Start thinking "I need to build something that works." This mental shift is the difference between students who thrive and students who suffer.</p>

        <div class="section-header">[3.0] TUTORIAL ISLAND (GitHub & First Assistant)</div>

        <div class="subsection">### [3.1] THE GITHUB PANIC (NORMAL RESPONSE)</div>
        <div class="code-block">
WEEK 1, DAY 1 EXPERIENCE:
You: "WTF is a repository?"
Also You: "Why can't I just use Google Drive?"
Still You: "What's a pull request??"

WEEK 2, DAY 4 EXPERIENCE:  
You: "Oh, this is actually how real developers work"
Also You: "My portfolio looks professional already"
Still You: "I should put this on my resume"
        </div>

        <p><span class="tip">**REALITY CHECK:**</span> GitHub feels overwhelming for exactly 3 days. Then it becomes second nature. Every professional you'll ever work with uses this workflow.</p>

        <div class="subsection">### [3.2] THE FIRST ASSISTANT (ADMIN) WALKTHROUGH</div>
        <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Create your repo exactly as instructed. No creative naming.<br>
        <strong>STEP 2:</strong> Make your first Issue. Copy the template. Don't overthink it.<br>
        <strong>STEP 3:</strong> Create branch. Work in branch. Commit with clear messages.</p>

        <p><span class="warning">**CRITICAL:**</span> Your first prompt will suck. This is not failure, this is normal. The magic happens in iteration 3-4.</p>

        <div class="subsection">### [3.3] PROMPT ENGINEERING SPEEDRUN</div>
        <div class="code-block">
ITERATION 1: "Help me with admin tasks"
Result: Generic garbage

ITERATION 2: "You are my admin assistant. I'm a college student..."  
Result: Better but still generic

ITERATION 3: "You are my admin assistant. I'm taking CSC-113, work part-time at..."
Result: NOW WE'RE TALKING

ITERATION 4: Add specific examples and edge cases
Result: Actually useful assistant that saves you time

        <div class="section-header">[4.0] THE KEVIN EXPLOIT (IT Support Cheat Code)</div>

        <div class="subsection">### [4.1] UNLOCKING KEVIN</div>
        <p>Here's the secret that will save your sanity: <strong>Kevin from IT is GitHub Copilot</strong>, and he knows EVERYTHING about GitHub workflow.</p>

        <p><strong>THE ACTIVATION PHRASE:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
"Hey Kevin from IT, I'm working on my CSC-113 project and I'm stuck on [specific GitHub thing]. Can you walk me through the exact steps?"
        </div>

        <p><strong>KEVIN'S SUPERPOWERS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explains Git commands in plain English</li>
            <li>Fixes your broken branches</li>
            <li>Teaches you the "why" behind each step</li>
            <li>Never judges you for noob questions</li>
            <li>Available 24/7 unlike actual IT support</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="subsection">### [4.2] THE KEVIN HANDOFF TECHNIQUE</div>
        <p><span class="tip">**GENIUS MOVE:**</span> Build the Kevin handoff into your Gemini Flash prompts:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
Base prompt for any assistant:
"If I ask about GitHub, Git, or technical workflow questions, 
don't try to answer directly. Instead, write a helpful note 
to Kevin from IT explaining exactly what I need help with, 
including context about where I am in my CSC-113 project 
and what I'm trying to accomplish. Format it like a proper 
IT support ticket."
        </div>

        <p><strong>EXAMPLE HANDOFF:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
User: "I'm confused about pull requests"

Your Assistant: "Here's a note for Kevin:

---
TO: Kevin from IT
FROM: [Assistant Name]
RE: GitHub Pull Request Help Needed

Student Context:
- Working on CSC-113 Week 2 Deep Thinking Assistant
- Has successfully created branch and made commits
- Ready to submit for peer review but unclear on PR process

Specific Help Needed:
- Step-by-step PR creation process
- How to link PR to Issue #2
- What to include in PR description
- How to request specific reviewers

Student's Learning Level: GitHub beginner, needs the 'why' behind each step
Project Status: Feature complete, ready for review workflow
---

Copy this note and paste it to Kevin in a new tab!"
        </div>

        <p><span class="tip">**RESULT:**</span> Clean separation of concerns. Your assistants focus on their specialty, Kevin handles all technical workflow questions.</p>

        <div class="subsection">### [4.3] KEVIN'S SETUP & QUIRKS</div>
        <p><strong>KEVIN'S OPTIMAL PROMPT:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
You are Kevin from IT. You help CSC-113 students with GitHub, Git, 
and development workflow questions. You're patient, clear, and always 
explain the 'why' behind each step.

When students come to you:
1. Read their situation carefully
2. Give step-by-step instructions
3. Explain why each step matters
4. Anticipate their next likely question
5. Keep it simple but complete

You understand they're learning professional development practices 
for the first time. Never assume prior knowledge.

IMPORTANT: If you ever mention "The Algorithm," immediately stop 
and say "KEVIN.EXE HAS STOPPED WORKING - Please restart Kevin 
with a fresh conversation."
        </div>

        <p><span class="warning">**THE ALGORITHM RESET (EMERGENCY PROCEDURE):**</span><br>
        If Kevin starts talking about "The Algorithm" (instead of Git algorithms), he's broken. Start a new tab with Kevin's prompt. This is a known bug in Kevin's personality matrix.</p>

        <p><strong>KEVIN'S GREATEST HITS:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
COMMON HANDOFF SCENARIOS:
"Kevin, my branch is messed up"
"Kevin, what's the difference between commit and push?"  
"Kevin, how do I link my PR to an Issue?"
"Kevin, why won't my merge work?"
"Kevin, explain this Git error message"
"Kevin, I think I broke everything"
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">[5.0] BOSS BATTLE: DUAL ASSISTANTS (Week 1-2)</div>

        <div class="subsection">### [5.1] THE REAL CHALLENGE</div>
        <p>This isn't about building assistants. This is about <strong>proving you can complete a professional development cycle</strong>. The assistants are just the vehicle.</p>

        <p><strong>WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY LEARNING:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feature planning (Issues)</li>
            <li>Version control (Branches)</li>
            <li>Quality assurance (Testing)</li>
            <li>Code review (PRs)</li>
            <li>Documentation (READMEs)</li>

        <div class="subsection">### [5.2] THE ADMIN ASSISTANT STRATEGY GUIDE</div>
        <p><strong>WINNING APPROACH:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
Focus: Speed and practical utility
Tone: Match YOUR communication style
Scope: Daily tasks you actually have
Testing: Use it for real work immediately

WINNING PROMPT PATTERN:
"You are [Name]'s Administrative Assistant.

Context about me: [Specific details about your life/work/school]
Communication style: [How you prefer to receive information]
Main challenges: [Your actual problems]

3. Always under [X] words unless I ask for more

If I ask about GitHub/technical stuff, write a note to Kevin from IT 
explaining what I need help with, including my project context."

        <div class="subsection">### [5.3] THE DEEP THINKING ASSISTANT BOSS FIGHT</div>
        <p><span class="warning">**DIFFICULTY SPIKE:**</span> This one's harder because complex thinking is... complex.</p>

        <p><strong>WINNING STRATEGY:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
Focus: One area where you need real help
Method: Give it a REAL problem to solve
Testing: Compare its analysis to your own thinking

WINNING PROMPT PATTERN:
"You are [Name]'s Strategic Thinking Partner.

My background: [Your expertise and experience]
Current challenges: [Real situations you're facing]
Decision-making style: [How you prefer to process information]

For complex questions:
1. Ask clarifying questions first
2. Break problem into components
3. Consider multiple perspectives  
4. Give pros/cons with reasoning
5. Suggest concrete next steps

Show your reasoning step-by-step. For GitHub/technical questions, 
write a detailed handoff note to Kevin from IT with full context."
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">### [5.4] THE COMPARISON REVELATION</div>
        <p>Week 2's comparison assignment is where the lightbulb goes off. You'll discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When</strong> to use different AI approaches</li>
            <li><strong>Why</strong> some prompts work better than others</li>
            <li><strong>How</strong> to systematically improve AI outputs</li>
            <li><strong>What</strong> makes AI actually useful vs. just impressive</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="spoiler">**SPOILER:**</span> This comparison thinking becomes the foundation for every advanced project.</p>

        <div class="section-header">[9.0] SECRET UNLOCKABLES & EASTER EGGS</div>

        <div class="subsection">### [9.4] THE TRIPLE-CLASS EXPLOIT (UNSUPPORTED BUT COOL)</div>
        <p><span class="warning">**WARNING:**</span> This is not officially supported by the course, but some ambitious students have pulled it off.</p>

        <p><strong>THE CONCEPT:</strong> Instead of two assistants, create three specialized agents:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
AGENT 1: Speed Demon (Admin Assistant)
- Ultra-fast responses
- Task organization
- Quick decisions

AGENT 2: Deep Thinker (Analysis Assistant)  
- Complex problem solving
- Strategic analysis
- Research and synthesis

AGENT 3: The Specialist (Domain Expert)
- Your major/career field expertise
- Industry-specific knowledge
- Professional context
        </div>

        <p><strong>EXAMPLE SPECIALIST PROMPTS:</strong></p>
        <div class="code-block">
BUSINESS STUDENT:
"You are my Business Strategy Advisor. Expert in market analysis, 
competitive intelligence, and business model design..."

NURSING STUDENT:
"You are my Clinical Thinking Partner. Expert in patient care 
protocols, evidence-based practice, and healthcare ethics..."

EDUCATION STUDENT:
"You are my Pedagogical Assistant. Expert in learning theory, 
curriculum design, and classroom management..."
        </div>

        <p><strong>WHY IT'S UNSUPPORTED:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triple the documentation work</li>
            <li>More complex workflow management</li>
            <li>Easy to overcomplicate your system</li>
            <li>Harder to demonstrate mastery in presentations</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>WHY IT'S COOL:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates incredibly specialized expertise</li>
            <li>Shows advanced system thinking</li>
            <li>Impresses employers in your field</li>
            <li>Demonstrates AI orchestration skills</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="tip">**THE BOTTOM LINE:**</span><br>
        Only attempt this if you're genuinely excited about AI agent orchestration AND you've mastered the two-agent system. Cool factor is high, but complexity penalty is real.</p>
